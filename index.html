    <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in
       1945.[1] As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule
        variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice,[2]
         and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability
          concepts. -wikipedia.
